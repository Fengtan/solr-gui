  "body": "### Browse Solr documents with minimal effort.\r\nNo need to learn Solr's [query syntax](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Query+Syntax+and+Parsing): as soon as you launch Sophie, you will be presented with a list of indexed documents. Filters and sorters allow you to quickly find a specific document and inspect its content. Sophie leverages SWT's [virtual tables](https://eclipse.org/articles/Article-SWT-Virtual/Virtual-in-SWT.html) to scale well with large indexes and keep a low memory footprint on your workstation. An internal caching mechanism limits the amount of client/server interactions so browsing the index does not generate a significant load on Solr. All HTTP requests are logged using [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) so you see exactly what requests (and what load) Sophie sends to Solr.\r\n\r\n### Create, update, delete Solr documents\r\nSophie makes it very easy to create, update and delete a document: just point and click. This includes support for multi-value fields and date fields. Sophie offers an interface to backup and restore the index if you are afraid of messing things up. Local modifications are not sent right away to Solr: you decide to upload local modifications only when your confident to do so.\r\n\r\n### Perform common administration tasks\r\nA variety of operations can be done in no time: export documents into a CSV file for further analysis ; create, rename and delete cores ; swap two cores, for instance to swap new content into production ; reload cores to apply changes you have made to the configuration on disk without restarting Solr ; commit or optimize the index to speed up recently made modifications ; clear the index ; etc.\r\n\r\n### Sophie works everywhere\r\nSophie is written in cross-platform Java and relies on [SolrJ](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Using+SolrJ), a client library included in Solr and supported by the community. The user interface is based on [SWT](https://www.eclipse.org/swt/) which makes it look like a native application and works on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nQuick start instructions can be found on the [project page](https://github.com/fengtan/sophie). Detailed information can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/fengtan/sophie/wiki). Problems are listed on the [issues page](https://github.com/fengtan/sophie/issues). [Pull requests](https://github.com/fengtan/sophie/pulls) are welcome and bring good karma. You may find the [javadoc](http://fengtan.github.io/sophie/javadoc) to be helpful.\r\n",
